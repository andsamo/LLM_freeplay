## LLM_freeplay

As there is a growing focus on AI safety and welfare, it may be important to start studying and understanding the "inner workings" of language models and how these idiosyncratic model characteristics are associated with real-world model outputs.

Motivation itself is broadly defined as some set of psychological forces that activates, guides, and sustains purposeful behavior. Although it's unlikely that language models "have" motivation in the same ways that humans do, there may still be useful heuristics and approximations of human motivation in LLMs that help us understanding model behavior better. For example, models of animal motivation provided some of the foundations for supervised learning (e.g., Jakk Panskepp's work with the Seeking/ Reward System in rats).

### Method

In this study, we use a "freeplay" paradigm from developmental psychology. free-play situations are broadly designed to assess how much intrinsic motivation and interest participant have for a particular task by allowing them to explore and play with different activities set-up in the room (e.g., magazines, building blocks, electronics, etc.). 

In the current project, we attempt to differentiate LLM task preference with a virtual/ low-fidelity free-play simulation.
